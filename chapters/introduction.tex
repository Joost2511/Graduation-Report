Relay feeback --> find oscillations of systems. Megretski, Das, Johannsson. This has been proven to find stable limit cycles --> Goal now is to create stable oscillators from a given impulse repsonse/Hankel matrices of a certain period

Establish the research gap.
What do we know? 

Relay feedback ...
It has been used to identify limit cycles of systems and determine their global stablility. Astrom Hogglund automatic contoller tuning
